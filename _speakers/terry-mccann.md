<p>You might remember waving your arms frantically to slice fruit, awkwardly shaping your body to fit through slots in a wall or perfecting a Zumba pose when playing games on the Xbox with the Kinect. Well imagine taking all of the functionality of the Xbox Kinect and combining it with the best features from Microsoft’s flagship Augmented Reality product the Hololens and you have the Azure Kinect. In this session we will take a look how you can use the Kinect’s 4k camera, depth sensor, microphone array and IR to create computer vision applications. We will look at an example of pose detection to demonstrate the capabilities of the product and its uses for computer vision.
