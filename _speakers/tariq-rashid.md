<p>The last decade has seen huge leaps in Machine Learning and AI, with benefits across industries 
from the arts to health, from public services to consumer electronics. However there is growing concern 
about the safety, fairness and broader societal impact of AI. 
We'll see how machine learning and AI works, its strengths and weaknesses. We'll then discuss scenarios 
which demonstrate how poor or naive application of AI can lead to confidently inaccurate results, bias 
against some communities, loss of customer trust in your business, and further widen the digital divide. 
Issues will include poor and biased data quality, algorithmic transparency, tech culture and engineering 
discipline, explainability, and the more challenging question of corporate ethics.
Tariq will then guide us through the emerging global consensus around frameworks for understanding and 
assessing the safe, responsible and ethical use of AI in your organisation. This talk is suitable for 
all, and is designed for non-technical leaders in particular.
