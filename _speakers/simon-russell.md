<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I'm a UK based freelance motion graphic designer based in Ivybridge, Devon. 
I’m a motion designer and 3D generalist but a lot of the work I do is based around music and events. I’ve created visuals for artists like Elton John, Shawn Mendes and U2. I’ve created work for the Commonwealth Games, the LA concert hall and the Barbican.
I’ve also worked on shows like Black Mirror, Watership Down and the upcoming Dark Materials trilogy doing concept development, UI’s and visual effects. A lot of this work is driven by my more experimental work in visualising audio and sonification. I’ve recently started producing art with a robotic pen plotter.
