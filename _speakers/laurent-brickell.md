<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Hailing from the Caribbean and being a lover of water sports, I look after R&D and Technology at Organic. I have over 5 years’ experience working at the top with leading engineering, retail, and technology brands, helping them design and develop new technologies and bolstering their current ones whilst bringing a human centred approach to each practice. I specialise in end to end digital transformation projects and big data/AI driven Natural Search systems.

My experience having worked in sound, project management and software engineering has given me a unique perspective to lead a team of experts in UX, Design and Development that produce some of the top marketing and intelligent search projects in the UK.

Recently my focus has been building with a human-centered approach, starting at the research stage, and using human testing to build systems that solve root problems, rather than another tool that only solves some. Using big search data to take the guess work out of what consumers want, we have continuously pushed the boundaries of SEO and continue to build innovative tooling for the UK’s largest retailers.  </p>
