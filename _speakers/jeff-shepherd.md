<p>Is your team responsible for multiple services? Does your company have multiple development teams? In this talk, I want to share the story of the process my team went through to improve our efficiency in product delivery over the last couple of years. What we learnt works well to stop us becoming overwhelmed in the 'shift-left' culture. How we split operational work and ongoing maintenance activities alongside new feature delivery on multiple services. Also, how we work as part of the larger software development community in the Met Office to improve efficiency of other teams and vice versa. If you're a software developer or product manager looking to improve efficiency of service delivery then hopefully there is something in this talk for you!</p>
