<p>Is your team responsible for multiple services? Does your company have multiple development teams? 
In this talk, I want to share the story of the process my team went through to improve our efficiency in product delivery over the last couple of years. What we learnt works well to stop us becoming overwhelmed in the 'shift-left' culture. How we split operational work and ongoing maintenance activities alongside new feature delivery on multiple services. Also, how we work as part of the larger software development community in the Met Office to improve efficiency of other teams and vice versa. If you're a software developer or product manager looking to improve efficiency of service delivery then hopefully there is something in this talk for you!</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I have worked in both internally and externally facing software development teams and currently deliver ongoing development and operational support to a number of Met Office services that provide critical-to-life information to both the public and private sector organisations. My day-to-day is writing, building and deploying maintainable microservices using AWS serverless technologies. Alongside this I am passionate about automating processes and adopting working practices that will increase the teamâ€™s delivery efficiency without sacrificing quality of service.</p>
