<p>Our eyes are brilliant – evolving to utilise the brightest portions of the sunlight that bathes planet 
Earth – but they are not without their limitations. They are insensitive to light at wavelengths shorter 
than about 400 nanometres (Violet light) and longer than about 700 nanometres (Red light). But there’s a 
wealth of information contained within these invisible wavelengths of light. Planets, for instance, form 
out of the cool disc-shaped reservoirs of dust and gas which exist around stars during their own formation. 
The cool temperatures of these discs means they shine at infra-red wavelengths. In my talk, I will introduce 
two techniques astronomers use to study these discs in the infrared and how the data extracted from these 
observations is analysed to better understand how planetary systems such as our own Solar System came into being.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I'm Claire (she/her). I work as a scientific researcher in the Astrophysics Group at the University 
of Exeter, developing software and tools to obtain and analyse astronomical data. In particular, I use 
the techniques of interferometry, photometry, spectroscopy, and scattered light/polarimetric imaging to 
study the discs of gas and dust that exist around stars as they form. The ultimate goal is to better 
understand how planetary systems (such as our own Solar System) formed and what is responsible for their diverse characteristics. My interest in diversity extends further: I am the founder and current chair of 
PRISM Exeter (@PRISMexeter on social media), a network for LGBTQ+ individuals and their allies working and 
studying in the local STEMM (science, tech, engineering, mathematics & medicine) sectors.</p>
