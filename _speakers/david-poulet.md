takeaways:
 - understanding the difference between a "traditional" AI workflow and a "cognitive service" style AI workflow
 - appreciation of the range of pluggable AI services available in the cloud (focussing on Microsoft Azure)
 -  understanding how easily complex computer vision tasks can be implemented by non-data scientist developers using cognitive services

<p>I'll look at the evolution of "pluggable" computer vision services in cloud computing, with a focus on the Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services. 
These types of services are designed to democratise access to previously complex AI tasks and open them up to the broad population of developers as 
well as data scientists. For this session we'll look specifically at computer vision (object detection, facial recognition, image tagging etc) and if 
the demo gods are smiling I'll demonstrate a few fun things you can do with just a few API calls.</p>
