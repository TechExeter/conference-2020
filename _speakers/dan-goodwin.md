takeaways:
 - the value of designing for outcomes rather than outputs and what that means for setting a vision
 - the three things we need to get across when we're setting a vision - the context, the outcomes which a solution brings, how we know when those outcomes have been achieved
 - ideas for creative ways to set a vision which engage a team and start and keep them working towards it

<p>After you've heard this talk, you will go away with a head full of ideas on how you can motivate a team by setting a compelling vision and working with them to realize that vision. You will engage stakeholders, get the outcomes they're imagining out of their heads, and then get people excited about working on something which actually makes those outcomes happen. </p>
