<p>COVID-19 has transformed our lives, and we are more aware than ever of hygiene in public spaces. But touch-screens are still a ubiquitous part of the digital-out-of-home experience: from hospital kiosks and airports, to supermarkets and ATMs. Could there be a better solution? Ultraleap are innovating to create Touch-Free, a system of completely contactless touch-screens that allow users to feel and press buttons in midair. Antonia will be speaking about her work on touch-free technology, the challenges of designing a completely new kind of interface, and her hopes for its future application - including bringing the sense of touch into VR/AR experiences.</p>
