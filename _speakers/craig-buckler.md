<p>Docker is often shunned by web developers. It's considered too technical, unnecessary, or something for DevOps experts only. Tutorials can 
be impenetrable and rarely explain how to use Docker during development.It need not be that way. Knowing the basics will revolutionize your web 
development process on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Application dependencies such as servers and databases can be launched in seconds. You can 
use your existing editor and tools without polluting your development PC.</p>
