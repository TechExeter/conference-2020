<p>In this talk, we provide an overview of deep learning-based object detection techniques. Our review begins with the revolution 
of deep learning algorithms and how they have added value to traditional computer vision based object detection techniques. We 
explore different deep learning based object detection architectures and frameworks. In addition to this, we also review the 
computational requirements for deep learning. Moreover, we also look at  computer vision datasets for deep learning based object detection. 
Finally we demonstrate how to build your own custom object detector in real time using python libraries with a few lines of code.</p>
