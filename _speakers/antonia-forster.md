<p>COVID-19 has transformed our lives, and we are now more aware than ever of hygiene in public spaces. Recent Ultraleap research showed that just 12% of consumers believed that touchscreens in public spaces are hygienic and 50% said they are unlikely to use touchscreens again. But touch screens are still a ubiquitous part of the digital-out-of-home experience: from hospital kiosks and airports, to supermarkets and ATMs. Could there be a better solution? Using hand tracking and mid-air haptics, Ultraleap is creating completely touchless interfaces that allow users interact, feel and press buttons in mid-air without touching a screen or holding a controller. Antonia Forster, Unity Game Developer at Ultraleap, will be speaking about her work on touchless technology, the challenges of designing a completely new kind of interface, and her hopes for its future application - including bringing the sense of touch into VR/AR experiences.</p>
