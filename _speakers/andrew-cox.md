<p>Great design is so much more than a font or colour choice, it’s the art of communication. In this session, we’ll discuss how a designer’s skill set can benefit the customer throughout their journey and how to apply design thinking principles in the real world. We’ll look at how a human-centred process can help you, whatever your role, to deliver products that integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology and the requirements for business success.</p>
